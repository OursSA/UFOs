## Conclusions
### Drawback of the analysis

### Recommendations for Further Development
- The text-based fields are currently case-sensitive, which looks like a potential source of confusion. Users enter two-letter state codes, which are usually written in capital letters, but the corresponding data is lowercase. It may be easier to use the filters if they would accept input in any combination of cases. 

- The "Comments" field contains the most descriptive data, but is currently unable to be filtered or searched. If the use of the webpage is to find connections between sightings, it may be worth allowing users to search for words or phrases that appear in the comments for multiple entries.
